# This is the README file for my first website publication
Written by Charlotte O'Connell as part of the learning process for User Centric Frontend Development section.

It is a simple project which has logos of the different programming languages learnt (with logos linked from Wikipedia), with a link to the Wikipedia page for each language.

This was an exercise on creating links, images and publishing a webpage with css attached.
